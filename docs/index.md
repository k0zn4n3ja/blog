# A Moment in Time

I was living in London, working through various personal demons whilst taking whatever ill-advised truck-and-barter the city would throw at me for work. This was in my early twenties, when the body was robust and I could freely engage in my hobby of boxing another man for fun and no profit, several tens of thousands of kilometres away from my beloved mother's worried vigil*. I was living in Leytonstone, a solid working class neighbourhood with lightly simmering undertones young folk getting into gangs, and found a good gym called "West Ham Boxing Gym" nearby. 

For those who don't know England's boxing scene, West Ham is one of the finest amateur boxing institutions in the world, producing Olympians on a run-of-the-mill basis. Needless to say, the coach was not at all enthused on training a 23-year-old with no fights to his name given there were boys under ten in the place sparring rounds to make a grown man (me) blush. But, with a bit of negotiation, charm and base pleading, they agreed to add me to the kindergarten class and have me train with the aforementioned minature destroyers.

Other than the young ones the only other adult was a Syrian fellow in his late teens, and rather than have me punch small children I would exclusively spar with him. Round after round, weight classes not quite matching up, we would have a go to and fro in the manner you would expect a practice boxing match to proceed. 

Side note: if you think this is a story about me rising through the ranks and taking my place next to Lennox as a great of the British halls, prepare to be disappointed.

Now, we come to the point of this little story. After one of our little playfights I was getting changed in the locker and this little urchin, this little ruddeger comes up to me. He's maybe 10 years old and I assume he's an Irish traveller, mainly because:

1. He spoke with an Irish accent
2. He spoke with the confident air of a veteran deep sea fisherman
3. He really really looked like he liked fighting

So anyway he comes up to me and he says:

Boy: Did you see the blind feller at East Ham station? 
Me: No, no I didn't
Boy: He didn't either.

Oh ho ho - not bad, not bad at all!

Boy: Did you hear about the deaf feller at West Ham station

Now, I know what's coming next but I love a good joke so I need to play the straight man here. 

Me: No, no I didn't (tee hee).
Boy: Well he didn't either!

Ho ho ho, these jokes aren't great but I'm an easy mark and thoroughly tickled by the bit.

Boy: Why are you so shite at boxing? 
Me (continuing with the bit): I don't know, why am I so shit at boxing?
Boy: Oh no, that's not a joke, I'm really asking. You boys are RUBBISH.

10-7 round, set up on rule of threes and demolished in the closer. Still the best insult I've ever received.

* I conducted my short amateur boxing career entirely in secret from her up to an including a match, but that's another story. 

# How I Learn Stuff Fast (A Mistitle)

I do not believe in general advice. The poet Russell Edison referred to us humans as, "teetering bulbs of dream and dread". Each written record, of advice or otherwise, is but a message in a bottle from one of these informational prisms. We throw these messages down the river of time, but we cannot ever step into a bulb and confirm for ourselves that some solution indeed would apply to us too, umodified from the author. 

Which is to say, everything I am about to impart about my process of learning is exactly that - a message in a bottle, in this case thrown with all the other mental detritus onto the internet, where I believe I am the first to impart some nonsense about a practice of learning. 

I work in software, a field imprisoned in the noophilic, progessing at an insane pace. I am also unreasonably curious, and therefore find my attention directed involuntarily to all manner of subjects I simply _need_ to know about, yesterday if possible.

When I was younger this was not so much a problem; I would work or pursue some insane scheme, come home and either exercise or follow a thread of learning. I do have a life now, however, and find myself desirous of bathing in natural light, sipping coffee for languid hours at a time, absorbing Bach and God forbid, sometimes just lazing around. Having a - forgive me for saying this word - job as well means the time pressure is on.

Therefore! Until I do make enough money to engage in the fully aristocratic habit of doing whatever I want most of the time, I am forced to begrudgingly optimise my learning process, both to stay on top of my career _and_ maintain enough ability to poke into the many rabbit holes that engage my interst. 

Again, I don't give advice, so I offer this only as a record for your bulb's tinkering on its pass through life. Here are some general helpful discoveries I have made that have helped me learn things quickly. This list is mostly relevant to STEM type stuff, which is what I'm into now mostly, so you probably don't need much of this if you want to learn how to play basketball or something else fun:

## Just Read the Textbook

This is always the fastest way. Despite the university student's griping, textbooks are great. They are dense with digestible information progressing in exactly the way you need it to, and you can just read them like a book - you don't need to do the exercises (more on that below). Whilst there are a million textbooks for each subject due to how university publishing works, there are generally "standards" in a subject which these days are pretty easy to discern from online discourse. Some of my favourites:

- University Physics by Young and Friedman
- Russel and Norvig's Artificial Intelligence
- A Course of Pure Mathematics - GH Hardy

A note on the last one: for some reason math textbooks from pre-1970 are the hottest of hot fire. I could do a whole separate post on how I learned math up to calculus from old Soviet correspondence books and a smattering of old-timey British classics. 

Despite the preponderence of contemporary multi-media learning platforms, I do not find them superior to reading textbooks. Without any proof or method, I consider the depth of learning from books exponential rather than linear in the material you cover - so, for n-length material (let's say, words and images), you get n^2 learning from a book and only n from whatever combination of youtube videos, online courses, etc. I can't explain why but that is my experience. 

There is an interesting consequence if that's the case - there might be a time when the linear learning progress seems faster because of how quadratic functions increase in n. This also matches my experience, where I start off confused and irritated with a new subject but end up burning through complex scenarios at a very agreeable pace.

## Make Something in Tandem

You will note above that I suggest skipping the exercises when reading a textbook - for me at least I find some project I can work on which will apply the knowledge in the material. For all subjects but pure mathematics I believe this is quite feasible. Even for physical-based disciplines like robotics and electronics there are software based simulations (eg ROS or Robot Operating System) which allow you to apply knowledge without having to spend the sometimes considerable sums of money required to do it "for real".

I did used to take MIT Opencourseware courses and do the tests to test my knowledge, but unfortunately, that is incrdibly boring. I have a lot more fun and retention from actually making something related to what I'm learning - example, I am currently reading a book on databases and at the same time impleenting a database. I know this is basically doing a course on databases the long way but:

a) No money goes into a university administrator's faberge egg coffer
b) The autodidact can progress in whatever direction at the speed they prefer - this is actually a big deal. Audidactism allows you to follow threads of curiousity in ways that set coursework doesn't. If I ever miss something I need I just go back and learn that too. 
c) I am a stubborn fool, so there

## Use an LLM 

LLMs are great. Rubber-duckying, even with an imperfect conversation partner, is massively helpful to the learning process, and my younger friends, you used to have to _find someone_ in _real life_ to subject to your confusions. One can now engage a token predictor and they'll give you fascimile of a cogent answer.

The fact that they are imperfect is even better for learning - you can ask the LLM and then assess and confirm its response, learning in the process.

Things that used to have me stuck for days now get resolved in minutes because I have an endlessly patient, slightly careless tutor living in my computer. 

## Spaced Repetition is Probably Good

I used these a little and find they work. Don't have much to say here, I need to figure out a way to use them in a way that doesn't take too much time or effort. 

I had not considered it prior to this essay, but really what I am chasing is not time-optimization but flow. Wikipedia defines flow as, "...the mental state in which a person performing some activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment...". Whilst this article is about learning fast, not well, I must defer to the cosmic philosophers on this one. In Zen and the Art of Archery the author maintains that to hit the target you must not aim for the target, which unfortunately both sounds like new-agey gobbeldy gook and seems to be true. If I aim for optimization, I find myself learning slower and with less enjoyment. If I chase flow and enjoyment, I learn better and faster. There's a military maxim, 'slow is smooth and smooth is fast'. It may be a partial restatement of the archer's doctrine.

As an example, I don't use the spaced repition cards because, while I find they are fit for purpose, during learning they take me out of _flow_, that place where you jump between concept, conversation and practice near-unconsciously, totally engrossed in your subject. I use LLMs because, while imperfect, they keep me in and deepen my flow.

In unexpected conclusion, if I had some takeaway, I would suggest to chase flow, engage whatever tools get you there, and discard whatever doeesn't. Bon Voyage!

# On Comedy

I have always loved comedy. As a child I would keenly await each year's televised Melbourne comedy festival and crouch, alert, with VCR at the ready, to tape the four hour comedy bonanza for the next 365 days' repeated (to my sister's nauseation) consumption. My first careen into the internet (in 2000) was a rabid search for jokes - fullofjokes.com (defunct), funnyjunk.com (fortunately or unfortunately, alive and well), and many more now lost to me.

At the same time, I had no concept of _why_ I enjoyed comedy so much. In my teens I played around with various high-minded philosophical glazings of comedy as truth-to-power, vital satire, some high form of rhetoric and so on. Later, I thought of comedy perhaps as some kind of shortcut for new and enlightening concepts "snuck" to the audience by the greats - Carlin, Pryor and those guys. Anyway, this is the kind of thing heady teenagers with too many feelings think of.

I find most of these concepts to be false. My experience with comedians is that they are no more enlightened than anyone else (probably I am the fool for ever thinking otherwise), and often terribly broken petty-narcissists and attention seekers. Satire, also, hardly seems to make any change in the world. My appraisal of its effect seems to be mainly in instilling a knowing feeling, sometimes knowing superiority, in the consumer, or more usefully as a historical record of some set of mores and views in a people, curmudgeonly or otherwise (we thank you, Juvenal). 

And yet, to this day I have a fond love of comedy (though the grand thinkers of the craft have fallen away in my questionably valuable favour).

## Comedy Doesn't Mean Anything (Thank God)

They say (they being some scientists who I can't remember and who may be wrong) that laughter originally evolved in a function similar to tremouring in mammals - a surprise anticipates danger, if there is no danger laughter physiologically resets the body. 

Jokes then, are the manufacturing of surprise and resolution in quick succession, minus the danger. They are merely a trick, a slight-of-voice, piggybacking on a tool in our evolutionary box to survive the Savannah.

Am I just a laughter addict? I don't think that's everything. I opined to my wonderful wife that comedy has gotten me through many dark times, such that I hesitate to mark anything off-bounds for comedy (save the Divine, hold that thought). 

So here it is - I have matured beyond high-minded philosophising on comedy. I shall now engage in low-minded philosophising on comedy. It's a personal sort of philosophising, but this entire essay is quite personal so I hope you can forgive a little more. 

Comedy doesn't teach us anything - in fact, it's entire utility is in that it reduces. Laughing at something reminds us it is not God, that it is of our world and therefore of finite importance. This can be healing, this can be therapy. 

Consider the origin of comedic theatre - the Satyr plays, always between the great tragedies of Aeschylus and co. They were a reminder - "hey don't feel too bad, this is all of the Earth, and the Earth ain't sticking around for any of us." Comedy pulls us all down to Earth, and that is its only lesson. Some of us only need to learn this about work on Mondays and our friends, others move the boundary of "jokeable" further out, and only the purest materialists will joke about God. 

The Orphic Wheel, Apollonian striving, Christ. I think I understand why Christ does not joke much in the New Testament - it is not His domain. He sits above the things of the world, and perhaps left us jokes to pull down the remainder to their rightful location.
